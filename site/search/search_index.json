And this ensemble can be shown to have more flexibility in the functions they can represent. 12. Which of the following statements is true about stochastic gradient descent ? a) It processes one training example per iteration b) It is not preferred, if the number of training examples is large c) It processes all the training examples for each iteration of gradient descent d) It is computationally very expensive, if the number of training examples is large > Explanation: Stochastic gradient descent processes one training example per iteration. That is it updates the weight vector based on one data point at a time. All other three are the features of Batch Gradient Descent. 13. Decision tree uses the inductive learning machine learning approach. a) False b) True > Explanation: Decision tree uses the inductive learning machine learning approach. Inductive learning enables the system to recognize patterns and regularities in previous knowledge or training data and extract the general rules from them. A decision tree is considered to be an inductive learning task as it uses particular facts to make more generalized conclusions. 14. What elements describe the Candidate-Elimination algorithm? a) depends on the dataset b) just a set of candidate hypotheses c) just a set of instances d) set of instances, set of candidate hypotheses > Explanation: A set of instances is required.
